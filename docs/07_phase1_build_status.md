# 07 — Phase 1 Build Status

> **Snapshot date:** 3 June 2026 (IA split + AI pillar promotion)
> **Scope reminder:** Phase 1 = static high-fidelity screens only. No auth wiring, RLS, DB writes, payments, bookings, AI, live maps, real search/filter logic, or BD migration. Visuals must reference the six locked mock-ups in `src/mockups/reps_fullpage_*_v1.png`.

Status legend:

- **Shipped** — route renders the locked design at high fidelity, content in place.
- **Partial** — route exists but content is thin, awaiting copy, or has known visual debt.
- **Not started** — route file does not exist yet.

## 8. Phase 1 deferred (do not build yet)

The following are explicitly out of scope until Phase 1 visuals are signed off:

- Supabase auth wiring, session handling, RLS
- Database tables, migrations, real reads/writes
- Stripe / payments
- Bookings engine and calendar sync
- AI features (programme generation, chat, summarisation)
- Live maps / geocoding
- Real search and filter logic on `/find-a-professional`, `/in/$location`, `/professions/$profession`
- BD (REPsUK.org) data migration
- `/compare/$competitor` per-competitor comparison routes (Trainerize, My PT Hub, PT Distinction, Kahunas, Everfit)
- Per-AI-feature deep-dive routes (the 14 `AI_FEATURES` roll up under `/features/ai` only)
- Promoting Features to a top-level public-header item (currently lives inside the For Professionals dropdown by design)

## 9. Navigation (public header)

Top-level public nav (`PublicHeader`): **Find a Professional · For Professionals · Resources · About REPs**, with right-side actions Log in · Join REPs (→ `/signup`). The **For Professionals** dropdown is the professional-side gateway and contains: Overview (`/for-professionals`), All features (`/features`), the 5 pillar pages (`/features/visibility`, `/features/operations`, `/features/coaching`, `/features/ai`, `/features/growth`), Pricing, Compare plans, Join REPs. Mobile drawer mirrors the same structure as a "For Professionals" accordion. Train-by-goal and How it works are no longer top-level items.

## 10. Known visual debt

- `/terms` and `/privacy` — legal copy still placeholder via `LegalShell`. Awaiting final wording before promoting to Shipped.
- Final compliance audit (`reps-build-compliance` skill) should be re-run before sign-off to catch any drift in hex/radius/shadow rules across recently edited files.

## 11. Phase 2 candidates

- Resources CMS (currently static articles in `src/lib/resources.ts`).
- Real directory search + filters backed by the database.
- Auth + role-based redirects for `/dashboard`, `/portal`, `/admin`.
- Booking flow on `/pro/$slug/enquire`.
- Sitemap and `robots.txt` generation (not yet present).
- Per-profession and per-location SEO landing-page generation at scale.
